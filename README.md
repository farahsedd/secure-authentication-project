# Secure Authentication Project
### Project Objective
manedrouch

### Technologies Used:
- **OpenLDAP**:  
  (LDAP: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) serves as the centralized and organized directory service for efficient storage, management, and retrieval of user authentication / authorization data.
  
- **SSH** (Secure Shell):  
    employed for secure remote access to systems, ensuring encrypted communication between the client and the server during authentication and data transfer.
  
- **Apache**:  
  serves as the web server, managing role-based access to web-based applications and providing a secure environment for user interactions.
   
- **OpenVPN**:  
  employed to create a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access to internal resources through VPN tunnels, ensuring encrypted communication over untrusted networks.
  
- **DNS** (Domain Name System):  
  utilized for domain resolution, mapping domain names to IP addresses, and facilitating seamless access to resources within the network.
  
- **Kerberos**:  
  implemented for secure ticket-based authentication within the network, providing a trusted third-party authentication service.
